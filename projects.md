# Projects, Ideas, and Goals

## Near term goal:
### *I will develop a library of code samples and working projects that implement some of the tricky components of more complex sites and apps.*

### This will entail creating working examples of some of the following features (for instance):
* File uploader to S3 bucket.  First for generic files, then extended to handle images specifically, cropping and resizing them to be used as avatars.
* Implement a JWT authentication example.
* Implement Stripe payment component.  Extend to a scaffolded site that has a paywall for access.

## Mid term goal:
### *I will create a working demo that implements the fetures of a modern modern, multi-user, pay-for-premium website/application*
* The site will be generic, only enough content will be included to make the features make sense.

### User Story:
* *I want a site where I hit a landing page that gives me the option to view free content or pay for premium content*
* *I will be given the option to signup and create a user account*
* *I will be given the opportunity to upload a user avatar*
* *I will be able to pay to access content behind a paywall*
